![Hey there, I'm Cyris. I'm a software developer, a maker and infosec enthusiast. Check out my work](https://github.com/CyrisXD/CyrisXD/raw/master/bio.gif)

I come alive when I write code.

I have always been a great problem solver, an extrovert, great at socializing. I have always wanted the best for me; this motivates me to work hard to get the best things in life, things that were never handed to me growing up.

I started writing my first code in my first year of uni. My first language was C and then it hit me Whoa! hard. 
I even considered changing my major but I wasn't raised a quitter. But then I wrote my first HTML/CSS code and then it happened; the spark that was less distinct reignited the instant I saw my first web page and since then, I can't get enough .

I love applying responsive design principles and watching my web pages shrink to mobile screens and still look amazing. Its oddly satisfying and I think that I am kind of like those web pages; I am moldable, but I still keep my creative flare intact.

My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem solving, responsive design principles, website optimization. So far I have JavaScript, Reactjs,AJAX,JQuery,HTML5/CSS3,JSP,Bootstrap,Cordova,Tag Libraries and XML , Git/Github under my belt.
I have also been involved in Web services (REST) using JSON , Implementation of Implemented contactless EMV-certified QR Code Payments using ISO 18004-compliant encoding and visualization of data.

I am still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head and I am actively look for a job
